### Updater

Since this version brings many changes in terms of configuration, I've made a small program that will convert your files (config.yml, limits.yml and vouchers.yml) to the new format, including strings that use the legacy format (`&`) to [MiniMessage](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage).

### MiniMessage

Every string and message supports [MiniMessage](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage). Legacy strings (including `&` color codes) were deprecated for a long time, and is better to move one to a more modern system. With MiniMessage, you can add everything you want to any message: click events, hover, hex & gradient (<mark style="color:blue;">1.14.4+</mark>).

### Voucher Settings

#### Bind to receiver

Make the voucher usable only by the player who received it

```yaml
bindToReceiver:
  enabled: true
  message: '<red>You can not use this voucher, it belongs to {player}!</red>'
```

#### Cooldown

Put the voucher on a cooldown after each usage (e.g. allow them to use the voucher once a day)

```yaml
cooldown:
  enabled: true
  cooldown: 1d
  message: '<red>You can use this voucher again in {left}</red>'
```

#### Limit for bulk open

Limit how many vouchers can be opened at a time.

```yaml
bulkOpen:
  enabled: true
  limit: 5
```

#### Regex for 'regions' and 'worlds'

Since some servers might have different regions / worlds that follow a format, it is much easier to use a [RegEx ](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java\_regex.asp)expression than to list all of them. These options can be combined with normal strings.\
Examples:

* `regex:player_world_.+` - match all worlds that start with `player_world_`
* `regex:mine-\w+` - match all regions that start with `mine-`

```yaml
worlds:
  whitelist:
    list:
    - spawn
    - regex:player_world_.+
    message: '<red>This voucher can only be used at spawn or on a player world.<red>'
```

#### Regions

Allow or disallow players to use vouchers based on the region they are standing on.\
This function require [WorldGuard ](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard)6.x.x or 7.x.x.

```yaml
regions:
  whitelist:
    list: [boss-spawn-region]
    #
    # This message will be sent to players that attempt to redee the voucher
    # but they are not standing inside 'boss-spawn-region'
    #
    message: '<red>The boss can not be spawned here!</red>'
```

#### World blacklist

Previously it was only possible to whitelist certain worlds, now you can also blacklist them.

```yaml
worlds:
  blacklist:
    list: [world_nether]
    message: '<red>You can not use the voucher in world {world}</red>'
```

### NBT

{% content-ref url="../../readme/vouchers/configuration/vouchers-nbt.json.md" %}
[vouchers-nbt.json.md](../../readme/vouchers/configuration/vouchers-nbt.json.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Usages command

Previously, it was impossible to edit or view the usages of a voucher in-game. Now, you can use the `/av usages` command to do so.

* **/av usages \[voucher] check (player)** - Check the usages of a voucher
* **/av usages \[voucher] modify \[value] (player)** - Modify the usages of a voucher
* **/av usages \[voucher] set \[value] (player)** - Set the usages of a voucher

{% hint style="info" %}
## CHANGED
{% endhint %}

* `display_name` was renamed to `name`&#x20;
* Usages are now stored on a [SQLite ](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)database instead of a simple, YAML file

{% hint style="danger" %}
## REMOVED
{% endhint %}

* The GUI for `/av list` was removed, at least for moment
